# Niri Animations
A host for Niri Animations configurations to be shared using custom shaders built in with GLSL

> **Notice**
> We don't take animation configs that are not **Custom Shaders!**
This means that they must be written in GLSL or any other graphics programming.

# How to use these.
you need a basic knowledge of how config files work
usually you're niri config should be in `~/.config/niri/config.kdl`
open it and scroll down until you see a `animations` line inside of it, you can copy and paste different configs into it.

You are allowed to ask for a animation, contribute, and download any of them all you like
